## üí° **My SQL Philosophy**
In these projects, I've focused on writing **maintainable, performant SQL** that tells a story with data. I particularly enjoy:
- Transforming messy real-world data into clean analytical datasets
- Balancing complex business logic with query efficiency
- Documenting my thought process through comprehensive code comments
- Creating reusable SQL components (views, functions, procedures)

Each project reflects my approach to **problem-solving with SQL** - starting with thorough data exploration, then building iterative solutions that deliver actionable business insights.
### My Development style:

***ÔøΩ Clean Code: Documented, modular SQL with CTEs***

***üöÄ Performance First: Execution plans analyzed for every major query***

***üìñ Storytelling: SQL that explains the "why" behind the numbers***
